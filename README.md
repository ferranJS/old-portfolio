*Long long ago in 2019...*
# an old portfolio

This is an old portofolio I built in 2019 with a friend in order to learn a bit of Angular and web development.

This project was RE-generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.


## problems of the past
- an Angular project for a portfolio... (not even typescript should be needed)
- too many files (they could have been inline components)
- very slow js for background
- ugly responsiveness
- bad css

## to improve from now on

- make it responsive
- make it prettier
- add Universal for SEO
- add pre-commit hooks for Universal build & linting
- maybe use tailwind

- ### optimize:
  - background js (add service worker too?)
  - image/gifs with \<picture> element
  - meta tags order
  - meta tags content
